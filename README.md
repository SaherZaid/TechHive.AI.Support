# 🐝 TechHive AI Support

TechHive AI Support is a smart customer assistance platform designed to showcase how modern web technologies and artificial intelligence can work together to create an interactive support experience.
The web application allows users to ask questions related to products, policies, or support scenarios, and receive real-time responses from an AI assistant. With SignalR, messages are exchanged instantly in both directions, similar to WhatsApp or live support chat, without requiring page refreshes. Powered by OpenAI, the assistant generates natural-language responses that feel conversational and helpful. The project demonstrates real-time communication, secure API integration, clean UI design, and full-stack implementation using ASP.NET Core MVC.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user types a message in the chat interface.
2. The message is sent instantly to the server over SignalR.
3. The server forwards the request to the OpenAI API.
4. OpenAI generates a response and sends it back in real-time.
5. The chat UI displays messages without page reload — just like a modern live support system.
